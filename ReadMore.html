            <h2><strong> Silent Hill: The Short Message </strong></a></h2>
                <p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5 </p>
                <p><strong>Developer:</strong> Konami Digital Entertainment </p>
                <p><strong>Genre:</strong> Psychological Horror </p>

            <p>Silent Hill: The Short Message is a free-to-play psychological horror game that attempts to bring the franchise into a more modern 
                setting while tackling serious themes like cyberbullying and self-harm. While the game introduces some interesting ideas, its execution 
                leaves much to be desired.
            </p>

            <p3> <strong> Story & Themes </strong></p3>

            <p><Strong>1.</Strong>The narrative has potential, with dark, heavy themes that could have been truly impactful. However, the game delivers its message with zero subtlety, making it feel forced rather than thought-provoking. Silent Hill is known for its psychological depth and ambiguity, but here, everything is spoon-fed to the player. There’s no room for interpretation—just a constant barrage of heavy-handed storytelling that doesn’t trust the audience to think for themselves.
                The dialogue is also a major weak point. The writing feels unnatural, and the characters, particularly the protagonist, don’t speak like real teenagers. It’s as if the writers had never actually spoken to one. This disconnect makes it hard to connect with the cast or take the emotional weight of the story seriously.  

            </p>

            <p3> <strong>Gameplay & Mechanics</strong></p3>
            <p>>even if you follow the exact path you’re supposed to take. There’s no real strategy—just trial and error until the game decides to let you pass. It’s frustrating, not scary.
                The first-person perspective was an interesting choice, but without any meaningful mechanics, it just makes the game feel like yet another generic walking simulator. There are also live-action segments sprinkled in, which don’t add much and only serve to make the experience feel like a poorly executed TV drama.
                One of the game’s stronger aspects is its environmental design. The abandoned apartment complex is eerie and visually reminiscent of classic Silent Hill locations while still having its own identity. The grimy, claustrophobic hallways, flickering lights, and distorted reality shifts do a great job of setting an unsettling tone.
                Unfortunately, a cool setting alone can’t save a game.          
            </p>

            <p3> <strong> Final Verdict </strong></p3>

            <p> 
                Silent Hill: The Short Message had the potential to be something great, but it stumbles in nearly every way. The story is over-explained, the dialogue is awkward, and the gameplay is frustratingly shallow. The setting is well-crafted, but it’s not enough to carry the experience. Even though the game is free, it still feels like a waste of time.
            </p>
            <P> <STRONG>RATING: </STRONG> ★★★ (3/5) </P>
